# Machine Learning Analysis of Netflix Movies & TV Shows

## Overview
This project analyzes the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using a combination
of exploratory data analysis and machine learning–oriented analysis. The focus is
on data preprocessing, evaluation, and analytical understanding rather than only
visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about Netflix content including:
- Content type (Movie / TV Show)
- Release year
- Country
- Genre
- Duration
- Rating

## Approach
- Data loading, inspection, and cleaning
- Handling missing values and feature preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis to understand data distributions and trends
- Applying evaluation-focused analysis to understand data behavior
- Interpreting results using analytical and evaluation metrics

## Analysis Highlights
- Studied content growth trends over time
- Compared Movies vs TV Shows distribution
- Analyzed country-wise and genre-wise patterns
- Evaluated how preprocessing impacts analytical outcomes

## Learnings
- Importance of preprocessing before downstream analysis
- How exploratory analysis supports machine learning workflows
- Understanding dataset limitations and biases
- Evaluating insights beyond surface-level visualizations

## Limitations
- Dataset-specific conclusions
- Uses classical analysis and ML techniques
- Does not include deep learning models

## Future Work
- Extend analysis using predictive or classification models
- Add model explainability techniques
- Apply similar analytical methods to NLP-based datasets
